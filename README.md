## ðŸ‘‹ This repository is not the main focus. Please refer to our [website](https://alignmentsurvey.com/) and [arxiv paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19852.pdf) for more information!

For an in-depth analysis of **AI Alignment**, we extend an invitation to peruse our expansive and meticulous survey, which can be accessed [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.19852.pdf). 

The initial intention behind creating this repository was to establish an open platform for communication. If you have any questions or insights, and you wish to **share with others** who have read our survey, we warmly welcome you to initiate a discussion via **Github Issues**.

Please visit **www.alignmentsurvey.com** for further exploration.
